# üåç Temperature Trend Analysis using Google Earth Engine & Python
This repository contains a Python-based workflow to analyze long-term temperature trends over a selected region using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and ECMWF ERA5 datasets. The script leverages geospatial libraries and statistical tools to extract, process, and visualize temperature data over time, providing insights into climate change patterns.



## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze the temporal changes in lake area, helping researchers and environmentalists understand the impact of climate change, human activity, and other factors on water bodies. By calculating NDWI over the years, the code extracts the water body and uses clustering to differentiate between water and non-water areas. The analysis then computes the lake area on an annual basis and visualizes these changes.
