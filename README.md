# Air Temperature Monitoring
This repository contains code for monitoring the change 



## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze the temporal changes in lake area, helping researchers and environmentalists understand the impact of climate change, human activity, and other factors on water bodies. By calculating NDWI over the years, the code extracts the water body and uses clustering to differentiate between water and non-water areas. The analysis then computes the lake area on an annual basis and visualizes these changes.
